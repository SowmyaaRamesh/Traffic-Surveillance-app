# Traffic Surveillance App

An app that lets law enforcement officers flag suspicious and stolen vehicles. It notifies them once the vehicle passes through a toll gate.

The officers can flag the vehicles based on any one or a combination of the following criteria:

- Colour
- Model
- License Plate Number
- Owner name

For instance, let's say the officers flag a FORD FIGO model then all the cars matching with that criteria present in the central database of all registered vehicles will be flagged and an alert will be sent out whenever a flagged vehicle crosses a toll.
